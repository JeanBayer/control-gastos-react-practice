# Control Gastos React & Vite

This application is taken from the [course of Juan Pablo de la Torre](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/learn/lecture/29703958#overview), I added a feature to add the manual date and be able to filter the expenses by month, some applied concepts are as follows:


- useState, useEffect
- LocalStorage to persist the data
- programmation logic
- Vite
